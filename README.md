    You need to set your local Mysql server database info to store the app data correctly.To do so, check the "School.py" file
    If u find a problem running the "School.exe" file, go ahead and just try running the main file which is 

## Be careful 2:
    Add the following two paths to the PATH environment variable in the system variables, in order to allow the correct execution of the "School.exe" files:

        -C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Shell 8.0\bin
        -C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
